üîç Unveiling Insights from Dream 2000 Mobile Stock Analysis üìä



I recently conducted an analysis of the mobile stock and pricing strategies of Dream 2000, an electronics website. This study focuses solely on their available mobile phones and discount patterns, without comparing them to competitors.



Using a custom web crawler built with Scrapy in Python, I collected data on 211 mobile phones available on the Dream 2000 website. Here are some key findings:



- Brands and Models: The dataset includes mobiles from 12 different brands, with Samsung and Xiaomi in the lead, each offering 39 models. Most of these models fall within the EGP 5,000 to EGP 10,000 range, with 28 Xiaomi and 22 Samsung models.



- Price Ranges: The majority of the stock (105 mobiles) is priced between EGP 5,000 and EGP 10,000, followed by 40 mobiles priced under EGP 5,000.



- Color Variations: There are 43 different color options available, with black being the most dominant color.



- Pricing Analysis: The average price for all mobiles is EGP 10,100. However, focusing on the EGP 5,000 to EGP 10,000 range provides a more meaningful indication, with an average price of EGP 7,160.



- Price Drops: Interestingly, the average price drop from the original price is 15.1%, with the highest drop of 16.29% observed in the under EGP 5,000 range. Other categories show price drops between 14.5% and 14.9%.
